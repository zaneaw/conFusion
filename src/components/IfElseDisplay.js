{/*     Use && for a More Concise Conditional
The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

{condition && <p>markup</p>}
If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.

Solve the previous example again, so the h1 only renders if display is true, but use the && logical operator instead of an if/else statement. */}

{/*     Render with an If-Else Condition
Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.

MyComponent contains a boolean in its state which tracks whether you want to display some element in the UI or not. The button toggles the state of this value. Currently, it renders the same UI every time. Rewrite the render() method with an if/else statement so that if display is true, you return the current markup. Otherwise, return the markup without the h1 element.

Note: You must write an if/else to pass the tests. Use of the ternary operator will not pass here. */}
